# Hyperledger-ABAC
ABAC implemented in Hyperledger Fabric 
Steps To Run the network and Node.js (API)

Step 1 : git clone https://github.com/Mkaif-Agb/Hyperledger-ABAC.git

Step 2 : Navigate to the test-network folder "cd Hyperledger-ABAC/test-network"

Step 3 : Execute the script called run "./run.sh"
This will do the following 
* Remove the old wallet folder generated by CA so that we don't get any Authorization error.
* Drops HLF mongodb database which is used as an Off-Chain Database.
* Clears old network volumes and containers.
* Generates the MSP and Instantiate all the peers along with them joining the channel.
* Deploys the related chaincode on that channel.
* Downloads the Required Modules and Starts the Server 

A Postman Collection is provided which can be imported in Postman to do API testing.
Flow of the APIs are as follows.
* Register all the roles (Admin, User, Agent).
* Login as the role required to perform Transaction.
* Login as Admin to Invoke the transaction "Register Agent" (Only admins are allowed to invoke this transaction)
* Login as Agent to Invoke the transaction "Register User"  (Only Agents are allowed to invoke this transaction)
* Any role (User, Agent, Admin) is allowed to do the transaction "Get User Details".

Network can be stopped by using ./network.sh down.
